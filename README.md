# Machine-Learning
A collection of problems solved using various types of machine learning methods in python.  
  
  
As I learn about the various methods and models used to carry out tasks such as regression, classification, clustering, reinforcement learning, deep learning and more, I will implement each method/model in python using the appropriate library to solve some relevant problem.
